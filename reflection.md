The main objective of this assignment was to develop a simple stick game that allows players to take turns removing sticks from a 
pile while ensuring robust input validation and user engagement. Additionally, I aimed to implement good usability principles and 
track player losses over multiple rounds. This encompassed understanding game logic, user experience, and effective coding practices.


To solve the problem, I began with research and planning. I outlined the rules of the game and identified the necessary features, 
such as player turns, input validation, and loss tracking. Next, I structured the program into logical sections: initialization, game loop, 
player turns, and end-of-game processing. A significant focus was placed on input validation to handle errors gracefully and ensure 
a smooth user experience. After completing the initial code, I ran various test cases to verify correct behavior under normal and 
edge conditions, which helped refine the program further.

Throughout this assignment, I explored several key concepts, including user input handling and validation, control flow with loops and 
conditionals, basic game logic, and state management. Additionally, I learned about usability principles in programming, emphasizing the 
importance of clear instructions and user-friendly interactions.

Overall, the results matched my expectations. The program functions as intended, allowing players to take turns, validating their inputs, 
and announcing the winner at the end. I tested various scenarios, including valid inputs (within the allowed range), invalid inputs 
(outside the range or non-numeric), and edge cases (like exactly 10 and 100 sticks). This thorough testing confirmed the reliability 
of the game's functionality.

The primary challenge I encountered was structuring the program logically while ensuring effective handling of all user inputs. 
Initially, I struggled with managing the flow of the game and implementing the various features seamlessly. However, I made an
effort to follow the first three rules of programming: maintaining a clear structure, robust input handling, and thorough testing. 
I overcame these challenges by breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable steps and iterating on the code until it met all requirements.

In conclusion, this assignment taught me the importance of clear planning and structuring before diving into coding.
Testing various scenarios not only helped identify potential bugs but also improved the overall reliability of the code. 
I believe I learned what I was supposed to learn from this lab, particularly regarding user interaction and game logic. 
Working independently allowed me to develop my problem-solving skills, although it also highlighted the value of collaboration
and feedback from peers. Overall, this experience was enriching and contributed to my growth as a programmer.
